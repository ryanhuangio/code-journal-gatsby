If you want to check the status of a Facebook conversion tracking pixel or any other kind of tracking code implemented on a website, you can follow these steps. This guide specifically uses the Google Chrome extension called Ghostery, but similar extensions are available for Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer.

## Install Ghostery

- [Google Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij?hl=en)

- [Ghostery Official Website](https://www.ghostery.com/)

Once you have installed Ghostery, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to your website.
2. Look for the blue ghost icon in your browser's toolbar and click on it.
3. If your tracking code is implemented correctly on your website, Ghostery will display it.
4. If the tracking code does not display, it means either the code is from a vendor not detected by Ghostery or it is not implemented correctly. The latter is more likely, as Ghostery's database is relatively comprehensive.

By following these steps, you can verify the implementation of a conversion tracking pixel or any other tracking code on your website.
